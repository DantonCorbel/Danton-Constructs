  <h2> About </h2>
  <p>This website is dedicated to my learning journey in construction.</p>
  <p>There are 2 types of construction being learned:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#coding">
      Coding</a>
    </li>
        
    <li><a href = "#woodwork">
      Woodwork</a></li>
 </ul>
<p> I am a novice in both woodwork and computer coding, but am keen to learn both.
I will be developing my woodworking blog pages as I learn to code, likewise developing coding pages as I learn to code!</p>

<p id = "NB"> NB! This page will change as my skills develop
</p>

<h3 id = "coding">Why Coding? </h3>
 <p>Initially, in about 2013, there was a news article about school children beginning to learn to code from the early years. I felt extremely jealous and did not want to get left behind! The news article sign-posted me to some beginner games that taught the first principles of code, as well as to <a target = "_blank" href="http://www.codecademy.com">Code Academy</a>. I started learning to code then, but was studying for a medical degree at the time so when it became difficult and I had exams to pass, it fell to the wayside.</p>

 <p>Then I wanted to develop my own app. It was a highly ambitious idea, formed in about 2014, when I couldn't find the app I wanted to help me learn medical imaging interpretation. I began to learn 'Swift', the Apple App coding, after my final medical school exams in 2015, but this soon went beyond my capabilities at the time. Besides, I was meeting my now wife, so courting was much more serious business!</p>

 <p>I have just been on a long-haul flight (2017!), where the film 'Hidden Figures' was being shown. It is about African American women before segregation was abolished. These women were brilliant mathematicians, and were instrumental in many top NASA projects being accomplished. One of these women saw the changing age of computers, and taught herself and her colleagues to code, so that when computers took over the task of the complex calculations they had been doing by hand, these women would be able to step in and help code the computers to do these calculations accurately.</p>

 <p>I have also started to learn woodwork (more about that below), and having watched several YouTubers in order to learn some of the basics, I started to think that I, too, could commence a YouTube blog as I learnt the carpentry and joinery skills. In researching about how to be a YouTuber, I came across information that it would be better to have my own website on which to host written blogs as well. Thus, my dream of learning to code was re-ignited! I started with HTML: How to build a webpage, and I had thought I would have to sit for days and days before producing anything for the web, but then I thought, why don't I just show what I am learning, and develop my webpages as I go? </p>

<h3 id = "woodwork">Why Woodwork? </h3>
 <p>I can't really say when I first harboured the idea that I would like to be more proficient at DIY, more specifically making things with wood. I began to dream of putting myself through classes when I could afford the time and money after medical school finished. This was definitely a concrete thought when I lived on my own in my final year.</p>
 <p>This was one of the topics I spoke about whilst dating my now wife in the break between finals and working life commencing. Little did we know that working life was going to make it very difficult to pursue this goal, however for my first birthday together my wife bought me a fold-away work bench, some clamps, and a manual mitre saw. </p>
  <p>Well! I bought myself a beginner's woodwork book, and discovered joinery. It all looked easy, but my first attempts have not been as slick as I would like. An disappointing evening class did not teach me the essential basic skills.</p>
  <p>So I began to use YouTube. And as I used YouTube, I began to wonder, could I start my own channel? There aren't many women making video blogs about woodwork. I am only a novice, but surely I could use a video blog as a means to help me learn to build? To learn all those joinery techniques, and show others my good times, my bad times, my frustrations, my mistakes, and hopefully my improvements! </p>
  <p>Wishing to learn to document, film, edit, all myself, I realised that I would, too, have to try learn coding again. So why not make the two work for each other?</p>
